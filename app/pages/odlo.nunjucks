                        Odlo wanted its success in Europe to be replicated in Singapore, and ZALORA Advertising Platform proved to be the bridge
                        that connected the sports performance brand to customers who were focused on fitness.

                    <p>
                      Odlo, a premium sports brand originating from Switzerland, enjoys enormous success in Europe but faced difficulty breaking into Singapore.
                      With no offline presence, Odlo had limited visibility to its potential customers.
                      As such, they engaged ZALORA Advertising Platform as a means to build brand presence and drive performance.

                    <h5>Targeting of Sports-Centric Customers</h5>
                    <p>
                      Odlo ran a paid advertising campaign via ZALORA Advertising Platform, targeting fitness enthusiasts through Facebook,
                      Mobile and Google Display Network. Three onsite campaigns were also pushed concurrently to introduce the brand
                      to existing ZALORA customers.

                    <h5>A Podium Finish for Odlo</h5>
                    <p>
                      Through ZALORA Advertising Platform, Odlo enjoyed an exponential increase in brand awareness which put it
                      alongside other top sports labels in the market. Post-campaign, Odlo also gained valuable insights into their
                      customers by analysing the bounce rates through each customer funnel and understanding their main customer demographics.
